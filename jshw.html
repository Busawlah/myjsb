                    Hi there! My name is Adebusola adewale. I am a graduate of Geology from the University of Ilorin. This is mini website of mine and I'll be telling you a bit about me here. Without further ado, lets get to it!
                </p>
                <p>
                    I'm an aspiring software developer, precisely backend. I'll almost say my relationship with software development is toxic because as much as I am so Interested in it, it doesn't come easy enough for me to learn, I've come to realise that it takes time, efforts, grit, hardwork and perseverance. I have tried self learning for a while and I had too many unanswered questions. I spoke to a friend about it and he introduced TIIDELab to me. The experience so far has been wonderful although it has not been easy considering I am combining the classes with work schedule. I was class governor once, was nominated for governorship 3 times in a row and I loved every feeling that came with each win. Grateful for my baby steps and I believe i'll come out victorious.

                    At TIIDELab, I am currently learning HTML and CSS.
